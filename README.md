# Movie library database JavaScript

The goal of my project is to create a movie library database for a community. A table lists the data on the films watched and the data on the people, per person. This database helps people in choosing films.

More details in the JavascriptFilmtar.pdf file.

# Opening and starting the project

Navigate to the project directory at the command line, then launch the project with the node
index.js command in the project folder. Open a web browser and view the project at
http://localhost:3000. The application uses a MongoDB
database.
